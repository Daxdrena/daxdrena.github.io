### Site ASBL


There is a exercice for learning HTML/CSS from a template.

In this case I will take a template and only modify with html and css.

For the content, I choose an ASBL.

If they love my work they can use it for their site for free.

My spirit during this work was : _"When it is obvious that the goals cannot be reached, don't adjust the goals, adjust the action steps."_ by : Confucius.
